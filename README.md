# Chat app CSS illustration

![preview for the Chat app CSS illustration](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)



## The challenge

Your users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Optional: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

## My process
***

### Built with 
- Semantic HTML5 makeup 
- CSS sustom properties 

## What I learned 

- I learnt to create responsive chat app for all devices 

## Where to find everything
Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the 'design' folder . You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

 The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you will need to use your best judgement for styles such as 'font-size', 'padding' and 'margin'. 

 You will find all the necessary assets in the 'images' folder.
